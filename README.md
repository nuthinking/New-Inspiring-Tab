## New Inpsiring Tab!

**This is a Google Chrome extension to randomly pick an inspiring web page to show as new tab page before you head to your new destination**

***Why having a page loaded in your new tab?***
There are web pages that update frequently and that can provide an impressive amount of visual inspiration. An example is [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/).
You could also put your Facebook but the idea is not to get too distracted to avoid the risk to forget where you wanted to go. The more visual, the better.
